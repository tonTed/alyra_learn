## Subject
> You must then provide the unit tests of your smart contract. We do not expect 100% coverage of the smart contract but be sure to test the different possibilities of returns (event, revert).

## Supports:
- [Chai Assertion Library / API](https://www.chaijs.com/api/)
- [OpenZeppelin TestHelpers / API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-helpers/0.5/api)

## Todo:
- [ ] Readme
- [x] Remove the testing of all status (already test with `tryFcuntions()`), just add the current status check in each test
- [ ] Refactor status number by a value in each context.
- [ ] improve message in each `context`, `describe`, `it`
- [ ] change assert by expect
